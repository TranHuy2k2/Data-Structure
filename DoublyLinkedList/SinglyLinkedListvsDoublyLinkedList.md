**Conclusion**<br/>
- DoublyLinkedList has better Element Accessment, more efficient traversal while taking more memory space and more complicated implementation.
- SinglyLinkedList occupies less memory and easier to implement, but since it can only travel in one direction, it is less efficiency compared to DoublyLinkedList.
